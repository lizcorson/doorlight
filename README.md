# doorlight
Opening your front door will turn on a strip of LEDs inside. Never walk into a dark house at night! Plus, the strip lights up red so as not to affect your eyes' adjustment to the dark.

## Build it yourself!

1. Upload the doorlight sketch to your Arduino-compatible board.
2. Solder the circuit shown in the circuit diagram.
3. Make a case. I laser cut mine from acrylic. The laser cutter plans are in the caseplans folder.
4. Attach the command cord clips above your door.
5. Position everything as appropriate for your door and your wiring.
6. Mount the control box case to the wall with command strips.
7. Mount the door sensor to the door. Be sure to put the side with wires on the wall.
8. Slide the LED strip into the command cord clips. Secure the strip to to the clips using mounting tape.
9. Plug everything in, and you're good to go!
